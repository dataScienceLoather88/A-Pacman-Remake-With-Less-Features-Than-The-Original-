An attempt at remaking pacman for my object oriented programming course.

Cover art by me.

Music is from the video game "Digital Devil Monogatari: Megami Tensei 1" for the NES.

I used the following guide to understand and code ghost behaviour: https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior

The .rar file has a playable .exe (only for windows systems)

Game was made using the SFML library
